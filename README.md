Microprocessors System Interfacing
Lab Report-2

Connect a switch with RB0 and two LEDs with RB1 and RB2. User inputs a number from PORTC.
1. Calculate the numbers of 0s and 1s present in number coming from PORTC. Display
number of 0s on PORTD if RB0 is low and number of 1s if RB0 is low.
2. Turn on LED connected with RB1 if input number from PORTC is even.
3. Turn on LED connected with RB2 if input number from PORTC is less than 10.

Lab Report-3

Implement the following task in Proteus. Connect a push button and 8 LEDs with RA4 and PORTD respectively. Run Timer0 in counter mode and it should count to five and count should be displayed on PORTD. Microcontroller should be interrupted by timer interrupt whenever count exceed five and then all LEDs connected to PORTD should be turned on.
